    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Margherita pizza is one of the most iconic dishes in Italian cuisine, simple yet full of flavor. It originated in Naples and is made with just a few fresh ingredients: a basic dough of flour, water, yeast, and salt, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. The balance between the crispy crust, the tangy tomato, the creamy mozzarella, and the fragrant basil makes this pizza a symbol of Mediterranean tradition.</p>
    <p>Making a great Margherita pizza requires attention to detail, especially in the dough fermentation and the quality of the ingredients. The dough must rest and mature for several hours to achieve a light, digestible texture. Once stretched, it's topped with tomato sauce, shredded or sliced mozzarella, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and a few fresh basil leaves before being baked at a high temperature until the crust is golden and fragrant.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g (3 ¾ cups) of all-purpose or “00” flour</li>
        <li>325 ml (1 ⅓ cups) of water</li>
        <li>10 g (2 tsp) of salt</li>
        <li>2 g (½ tsp) of dry yeast (or 5 g fresh yeast)</li>
        <li>300 g (1 ¼ cups) of tomato passata</li>
        <li>250 g (9 oz) of fresh mozzarella (preferably fior di latte)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, to taste</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil, to taste</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Gradually add the flour while mixing. Once the dough starts to form, add the salt. Knead for 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>First rise and cold fermentation:</strong> Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then transfer it to the fridge and let it rest for at least 12–24 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the toppings:</strong> Cut the mozzarella into small strips or cubes and let it drain to remove excess moisture. Season the tomato passata with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Take the dough out of the fridge 1–2 hours before baking. Divide it into two balls. On a floured surface, gently stretch each ball into a thin round with a slightly thicker edge.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the toppings:</strong> Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough. Add the mozzarella, a few basil leaves, and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the pizza:</strong> Bake in a preheated oven at the highest possible temperature (around 250°C / 480°F or more) for 7–10 minutes. Use a hot pizza stone or preheated baking tray for best results. The pizza is ready when the crust is golden and the mozzarella is melted.</li>
    </ol>
