    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>
    <p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, such as adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
