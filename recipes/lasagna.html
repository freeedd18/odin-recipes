    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta, meat sauce, béchamel, and cheese. Originating from the Emilia-Romagna region, the traditional version—Lasagna alla Bolognese—features sheets of fresh egg pasta layered with a slow-cooked ragù made of ground beef, pork, tomatoes, and aromatic vegetables, all topped with creamy béchamel sauce and grated Parmesan cheese. This comforting and satisfying dish is often prepared for family gatherings, Sundays, or holidays.</p>
    <p>The preparation takes time and care, as each component plays a crucial role. The ragù should simmer gently for hours to develop depth of flavor, while the béchamel adds a smooth and creamy texture that balances the richness of the meat sauce. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until golden and bubbling, with perfectly melded layers that hold their shape when sliced. The result is a hearty, flavorful dish that celebrates the essence of Italian home cooking.</p>

            <li>50 g (⅓ cup) flour</li>

            <li>Nutmeg, to taste</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For assembling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250–300 g (9–10 oz) fresh or dried lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>80 g (¾ cup) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Butter for greasing the baking dish</li>
        </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the ragù:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large pan. Sauté the onion, carrot, and celery until soft. Add the ground meats and brown them thoroughly. Pour in the white wine and let it evaporate. Add the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Let the sauce simmer gently, covered, for at least 1.5–2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the béchamel:</strong> In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the flour and stir for 1–2 minutes to form a roux. Gradually add the warm milk, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the pasta sheets (if using dried):</strong> Boil them in salted water for 2–3 minutes until al dente. Drain and lay them flat on a towel.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease a baking dish with butter. Start with a thin layer of meat sauce, then add a layer of pasta, more meat sauce, a layer of béchamel, and a sprinkle of Parmesan. Repeat the layers until the ingredients are used up, finishing with béchamel and Parmesan on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 10–15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and serve:</strong> Let the lasagna rest for about 10–15 minutes before slicing and serving, so the layers can set.</li>
    </ol>
