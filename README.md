# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project created as part of [The Odin Project - Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) curriculum.  
The goal of this exercise was to practice building and structuring a simple multi-page website using semantic HTML.

## 📸 Preview

The website includes:

- A homepage with links to three individual recipes:
  - Lasagna
  - Pizza Margherita
  - Tortellini

Each recipe page includes:
- A description of the dish and its origin
- A list of ingredients
- Step-by-step preparation instructions
- An image of the finished dish

## 🖼️ Images

All images used are sourced from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com).  
Proper `alt` text and image sizing have been added for accessibility and layout control.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- HTML elements like `ul`, `ol`, `img`, `a`, `div`, `h1`–`h6`, `p`, etc.
- Relative path linking between pages and assets

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring a multi-page static site with internal linking
- Writing clean, readable HTML code
- Using semantic tags for better accessibility and organization
- Organizing files and images in a logical folder structure
- Embedding and formatting images with `alt`, `width`, and `height` attributes
